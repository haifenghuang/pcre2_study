# pcre2_study

I'm studying pcre2 library, for me to remember what I'v learned, I've created
this repository.

It provides five methods:

    - re_ismatch: checks if subject string matches a pattern.

    - re_match: match subject string against specified pattern and returns the matched string in its last parameters.

    - re_replace: replace matches of regular expression with replacement in the subject string.

    - re_group_bynumber: match subject string against specified pattern(which contains group) and get the captured string by number.

    - re_group_byname: match subject string against specified pattern(which contains group) and get the captured string by name.
